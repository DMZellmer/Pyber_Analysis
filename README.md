# Pyber_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Pyber with data-driven insight into how the company performs in three city types:

*Rural
*Suburban
*Urban

This scatter plot shows the distribution of average fare and number of rides per city.  As expected, rural cities have a higher average fare and lower number of rides than suburban or urban cities. Longer (higher fare), fewer rides in rural areas, and as you move up in population from rural to suburban and then the highest rider/driver density in urban cities.


# Pyber Data Summary
![pyber_summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86337475/128650581-6899d120-76ef-4b8e-91be-d616309a10c0.PNG)

In this figure you can see at a glance the metrics of ridership and average fares for rural, suburban and urban city types. Urban ridership dominates total fares with double the fare seen in suburban cities and ten times more than rural cities. Based on these data, Pyber could continue to have a strong presence in urban cities, but also seek to expand the service in rural and suburban cities. Suburban cities may be better to focus on instead of rural, as suburban cities have higher populations and source of income.

Lifting the average fare lines from rural and suburban cities toward the urban city line through increased drivers and rides will generate huge profits for Pyber through the expansion of service in suburban and rural city types.
